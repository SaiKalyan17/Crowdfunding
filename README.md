# Crowdfunding
Our Crowdfunding Platform is a web application built using the MERN stack that facilitates the process of raising funds for various projects, causes, or ventures. The platform serves as a meeting point for project creators and potential backers, enabling them to connect, collaborate, and support innovative ideas and initiatives.
